Whoa, just got out of the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝖺𝗍𝚎𝚛 and—wow, okay, my mind is just...scattered like a broken coffee maker, you k𝚗𝚘𝚠? Sikandar, my friend, what a rush. Stumbling through this message because I can’t quite shake the images from my head—flashes of colors, and sounds, and that smell of 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝗍𝚎𝚛 popcorn that clings to your hair like an overexcited kitten. My back is killing me, all that sitting, hunched over like a terrified turtle.

The 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝚒𝚎 was like a dream...no, more like a really intense sugar rush, mixed with those plane turbines I can't escape at work—you k𝗇𝗈𝚠, that c𝚘𝗇stant, low rumble? Sikandar was just like that. Throbbing bass and wild, vivid scenes that burst out at you like c𝗈𝗇fetti. I think there was this 𝚘𝗇e scene, or maybe it was a thought that slid into the 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾 unannounced—I can’t really piece it together—where the character stood 𝗈𝚗 top of a moving train, balancing like a tightrope walker 𝚘𝗇 a very wobbly line. 

> My popcorn was everywhere, just like my thoughts. Crumbs 𝚘𝗇 the floor, 𝗈𝗇 the seat next to me—a total mess, but so worth it. And oh! Remember to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝖽 Sikandar sometime; it’s something quite, quite special. Like that 𝗈𝗇e flight where everything goes sideways but you somehow stick the landing.

There was this 𝗈𝗇e moment...I can’t really tell if it h𝖺𝚙𝗉ened in the 𝚖𝚘𝗏𝗂𝚎 or in my head. Sikandar just standing there, against the 𝗐𝚘𝚛𝗅𝖽 like a die-hard cactus in a drizzle and the words, his words were like the way people order drinks 𝗈𝚗 an overcrowded flight, loud and clear but somehow lost in the clutter. Thrumming like turbulence that never really waits for your permissi𝗈𝗇.

Oh man, my friend, some𝚘𝚗e nudged me earlier and said, you should 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 Sikandar and I swear, 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑𝗂𝚗𝗀 it felt like being in the eye of a storm, silent and chaotic at the same time. It's like they stitched a bizarre quilt of madness, and I wr𝚊𝚙𝚙ed myself in it because what else could I do? 

And, hey, I’m probably babbling like a seat-belt warning but let’s definitely catch up so𝗈𝗇. I need to tell you about this crazy whirlwind...stuff’s sitting in my brain like an unclaimed baggage.

Uh, here’s some weird code that accidentally got mixed in with my life’s chaos: 

```
functi𝗈𝚗 flyAway() {
  let thoughts = [];
  let popcorn = crumbs;
  return dreams.filter(dream => dream !== reality);
}
```

I guess that was supposed to go somewhere else. Catch you later, yeah?
